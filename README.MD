What is Tic Tac Toe Game like?
It is a very simple, two player NO AI based Tic Tac Toe game. There is a background music taken from "vgmusic.com"
The game has a score counter functionality as well. All information is displayed in the game's status bar.

Why did I chose Tic Tac Toe?
This is for my Java Homework at Estonian IT College. Tic Tac Toe isn't very complex, yet kind of challenging , and
is indeed a very interesting game to play.

Are there any bugs?
So far I haven't noticed any.

Is this the final version?
No. This is Version 0.1FR. I'll be working on the Minimax AI and possibly a 3d Tic Tac Toe next year.

What licence are you using?
As you can see it's the Apache licence. It is quite liberal.
